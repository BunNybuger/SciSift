    "Article name": "An embedded toolset for human activity monitoring in critical environments",
    "Citation": "(Di Benedetto et al., 2022)",  
    "Year of the article": 2022,
    "DOI": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117125",
    "Brief summary": "The paper presents a modular embedded system for monitoring human activities in critical environments. The system uses computer vision and AI to perform tasks like estimating crowd density, measuring social distance, and detecting personal protective equipment. The modules can be combined and configured based on needs. Experiments validate the system's effectiveness for safety monitoring.",
    "What is detected in this paper?": "The system detects pedestrians, measures interpersonal distances, estimates crowd density, and detects personal protective equipment like helmets, high-visibility vests, and face masks.",
    "Detected object hashtag": {
      "PPE": ["Helmets", "High-visibility vests", "Face masks"],
      "Actions": [],  
      "Body posture": []
    },
    "Method and the technology employed in the paper for detection": "The system uses deep learning models like Faster R-CNN for pedestrian and PPE detection. It also uses a density estimation model based on CSRNet for crowd density estimation.",
    "Primary focus": "#vision",
    "Other technologies or tools used": ["Faster R-CNN", "CSRNet", "DeepSort tracker"],
    "Method of measuring performance": "Mean average precision (mAP) for detection tasks. Mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM) for density estimation.",
    "Achieved performance": "Pedestrian detection mAP: 0.836. PPE detection mAP: 0.606. Density estimation MAE: 92.28, RMSE: 365.4, SSIM: 0.79.", 
    "Key points and the value of the research": "The system's modularity allows easy reconfiguration and expansion of capabilities. Monitoring human activities in critical environments like pandemic outbreaks can help enforce safety rules.",
    "Suggestions or recommendations for future research": "Automatically select best counting approach based on scene. Expand with more capabilities like gesture recognition. Use synthetic data for social distance training.",
    "Limitations": "Limited to monitoring single planar surfaces. Density estimation struggles in extremely crowded scenes.",
    "Dataset": "New datasets collected: CrowdVisorPisa for pedestrian monitoring, and CrowdVisorPPE for PPE detection. Also uses various public datasets like MOT and ShanghaiTech.",
    "Sharing Dataset?": "CrowdVisorPisa and CrowdVisorPPE provided upon request",
    "Personal ideas or insights": "The system seems flexible and practical for safety monitoring applications. Interesting use of both synthetic and real data. More work needed to handle complex environments.",
    "Funding": "Partially supported by EU H2020 projects like AI4EU and AI4Media"
