Welcome to the SciSift repository!ü§ó With SciSift, you can effortlessly extract information from papers‚Äîeven directly from PDFs‚Äîand save it in your desired format, be it JSON, markmap, HTML, etc. Simply dump a collection of PDF papers and retrieve JSON files for each. Then, utilize the provided code to merge these JSON files, producing a comprehensive table with all the extracted details from your papers! I've tested SciSift on dozens of papers that I previously read and synthesized manually. The results? Absolutely remarkable. In a few seconds, SciSift extracts information, perhaps even better than I could!

SciSift is powered by a robust language model named Claude. This model can process documents containing up to 100,000 tokens, ensuring the efficient extraction of vital details. Such capacity enables us to read an entire paper in one go‚Äîsomething that is harder to do with ChatGPT.


## How to try SciSift? 

Currently, the easiest method is through this link: [poe.com/SciSift](https://poe.com/SciSift). Simply click on the link and upload your paper! Please note that only the first few attempts are free. Sorry! This is Poe's policy, not mine.

If you have an account with Claude, you can also run it directly on [claude.ai](http://claude.ai). However, you'll need to copy the prompt yourself.

## Background

I'm a PhD student immersed in the realm of Machine Learning. Navigating through a scoping review, I felt the weight of keeping current with the daily influx of new papers in my field. Pondering this challenge, my supervisor mused, "Why don‚Äôt you have an LLM sift through these papers for you?" Surprised, I asked, "Is it okay to do that?"ü§î He replied, "Yes, as long as we're transparent about our methodology and clearly mention how we did that!"

And thus, SciSift was conceived. üòä

## Contribute

SciSift is still in its early stages and was initially tailored to meet my research needs. However, with your help, its capacity to adapt and cater to a wider demographic is undeniable. Interested in contributing? Check out the prompt file, modify it to suit your requirements, and submit a pull request. Your contributions will be acknowledged, ensuring others can access and benefit from them in your name.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
