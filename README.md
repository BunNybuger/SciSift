# SciSift

Welcome to the SciSift repository!ðŸ¤— With SciSift, you can effortlessly extract information from papersâ€”even directly from PDFsâ€”and save it in your desired format, be it JSON, markmap, HTML, etc. Simply dump a collection of PDF papers and retrieve JSON files for each. Then, utilize the provided code to merge these JSON files, producing a comprehensive table with all the extracted details from your papers! I've tested SciSift on dozens of papers that I previously read and synthesized manually. The results? Absolutely remarkable. In a few seconds, SciSift extracts information, perhaps even better than I could!

SciSift is powered by a robust language model named Claude. This model can process documents containing up to 100,000 tokens, ensuring the efficient extraction of vital details. Such capacity enables us to read an entire paper in one goâ€”something that is harder to do with ChatGPT.

## Background

I'm a PhD student immersed in the realm of Machine Learning. Navigating through a scoping review, I felt the weight of keeping current with the daily influx of new papers in my field. Pondering this challenge, my supervisor mused, "Why donâ€™t you have an LLM sift through these papers for you?" Surprised, I asked, "Is it okay to do that?"ðŸ¤” He replied, "Yes, as long as we're transparent about our methodology and clearly mention how we did that!"

And thus, SciSift was conceived. ðŸ˜Š
